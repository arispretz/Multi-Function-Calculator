# Multi-Function-Calculator

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "College Algebra with Python" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using Python.
Make your own functions
Building upon what you did in previous steps, define a different function for each of the following:

Add, subtract, multiply, divide
Detect prime numbers
Generate prime factors of a number
Simplify square roots
Solve for a variable
Each function should prompt the user with a question, take input, and output the answer.

Create a menu
Use print statements to create a menu that displays a numbered list of options. Then prompt for user input to choose an option. Use an if statement to print a different message for each option in the menu.

Multi-Function-Calculator
build a multi-function calculator. Use the menu and the functions you created in the previous steps. Define one more function of your own. Create the menu so that the user input will run a function.
